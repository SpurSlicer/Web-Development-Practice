        <h1>Hello! I'm Spur :3</h1>
        <h3> <b>Pronouns:</b> he/him</h3>
        <p> <b>Goals:</b> I would just like to be happy in life and make others happy.</p>
        <p> <b>Description:</b> I switch hyperfixations daily and really enjoy story-driven pieces of media, yoga, running, drawing,
        and coding really colorful GUI applications and web-things! I am especially fond of the <em>webcore</em> and <em>nostalgia-core</em>
        aesthetics and am excited to make some--possibly jarring--websites and programs that use them!</p>
