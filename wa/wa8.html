                Modding a wii is easier than ever, and there is a lot of fun to be had on the console! Obtaining the console is the hardest part, but once that is complete, you will be able to play and create mods for nintendo video games in no time! The wii possesses a powerPC based operating system and certain memory exploits in games release for it that allow for hacking capabilities. The most interesting thing to me is modding video games on the console. Wii games come on discs and all contain their own boot loader to load the game into memory of the console. Games are compiled into a specialized format for the Wii console and are denoted with the .wbfs file tag. Unpacking these aren't extremely difficult, but modifying game code in an uncommon assembly language like PowerPC can be a challenege! Regardless, there still exists an enthusiastic audience dedicated to doing so.
