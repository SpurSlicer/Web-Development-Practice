                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p><b>Game:</b> Cave Story was created with windows native GUI programming and originally occupies an impressive 4kb despite containing 2-4 hours of gameplay. Cave Story was compiled to x86-32 assembly to run on windows machines and was coded in C++ despite primarily using C. Cave Story has its own stage format and encoding scheme for entities and was built entirely from the ground up. Cave Story was in several years of development as a passion project and has an infamous beta that differs widely from the game we received in 2004.</p>

                <h3>Modding</h3>
                <p><b>Engines:</b> Modding Cave Story is a relatively simple process once you get your head around how the program works, but adding in native changes to the code is bound by memory constraints. However, recreations of the engine through projects such as <a href="https://forum.cavestory.org/threads/cse2-the-cave-story-decompilation-project.14657/">CSE2</a>, <a href="https://docs.libretro.com/library/nxengine/">NX-Engine</a>, and <a href="https://doukutsu-rs.github.io/">Doukutsu-RS</a> exist to allow complete freedom to add in anything you desire. </p>
